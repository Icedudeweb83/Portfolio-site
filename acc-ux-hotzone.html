User needs included searching for resources by topic, and validating the credential or quality of the resource.

                         If my users are students, how can I appeal to their instincts or intuitions when they're navigating resources? As a student myself I'm familiar with my own instincts and those of others I've spoken with. I know that generally once students get moving, they don't want to fuss with going deep on reference material unless and until they need to. I know they want to trust they can lean easily into such material as they work. Also, they generally tend to gather what they need before they start. They want to find what they need and they want to trust it's reliable.

                                 I am a creative product designer driven by possibilities that, like good creative works, focus on universal emotions and appeal. No matter the project or who conducts the research, my general approach is the same: I consume data and absorb stories, and then commune with the big picture before applying the details to arrive at holistic solutions. My talent lies in purposely keeping the micro and the macro in close touch with each other as I ideate organic, human-centered solutions that cover all the bases.

                         The best part. From these qualities, I began to chew on what these things would have meant to me as an early UX student. What was I missing back then? I remember being curious probably a lot more than the other things. A lot of new terms came fast and furious, and because students take classes in different orders, sometimes you weren't sure what a term meant because you hadn't taken a class that talked about it yet. Maybe, even if you had heard it, you just needed to SEE IT to really get it. From this came the idea of a prototyping resource. That would also help with trust, and likely patience too.

                         My first concept is an interactive database that allows a student to import a resource, such as an article, or access it directly from a native browser (like you can in Slack). From there the student categorizes the resource by UX topic, which will allow them to apply a variety of features to further their learning, such as watching a video or... navigating a click-through prototype of the activity. A prototype could be especially helpful in demystifying a UX activity or practice that might be intimidating, as well as bridge the gap between watching/reading and actually <i>doing</i>. Which is the best learning. Interacting with a prototype could also help generate new student thinking or questions as well.

                         My second concept utilizes scanning and augmented reality to locate UX topics and take the student to resources. On the scanning side, the student can turn on a word search feature that directs them to relevant articles or the right place in the class textbook. On the augmented reality side, the student can do the same thing across two screens should they want to use reference material on a second device. It can also be used to recognize activities visually by sight. AR could be a major boon to reducing cognitive load between recognizing you need a resource, and the need to tax your brain searching for the right resources manually in many locations.

                         After putting down these initial constructs, I started thinking about design features. What kinds of colors or features should I use? What kind of aesthetic might inspire greater use or additional ideas? Well, I knew the school's logo colors already made a strong statement in terms of boldness and contrast. And I knew I wanted slick, modern graphical qualities in my buttons and icons. So I experimented with some color schemes and design elements, and began integrating them into my iterations to move my design thinking along.

                         Now that I had ideas and some elements to work with, I started improving my screens to generate more thinking. For my interactive database concept, I built out some search results and added icons to the interactive options; this immediately made things feel more user friendly. I also experimented with adding a carousel to the topic selection feature. For the prototype screen I built out a more cohesive feature with a topic definition, instructions and a more intuitive task flow interaction.

                         For scanning/augmented reality, the big improvement came from icons. They identify topics with far less need for words, which economizes space and creates less interference with native article elements such as graphics or images. This is especially helpful with AR, where the app would be populating and repopulating graphics as it scans the real world. Indeed even additional information in icon form could be added to an AR screen without making things too busy (see last slide). Icons also helped in designing a results page, where they not only keep things looking tight and organized, but also allow results to mingle without losing clarity as to what kind of resource it is (textbook, web, video).

                         Much as icons improved my AR concept, interaction improved the article database. Though the initial design largely shows what I intended, the concept depends strongly on interaction. And with interaction, I've learned, comes room for improvement. I switched from checkboxes to toggles, added a profile feature for personalization, and added preview screens, tags and like options. However I knew there could be more...

                         As much as I loved working with an augmented reality concept, and as much as I wanted to continue exploring it, I realized I wanted (and needed) to connect with the option that would best fulfill the challenge: not just finding resources, but <i>validating</i> those resources. I knew the article database was the best choice for this. Not only could validation be part of my work, but I could further explore interaction design, which is what would allow for validation in this solution. I also realized I could further my general design features more easily with a high fidelity iteration of this concept. So article database it is!

                         Looking at my high fidelity screens, I knew there was room for even more improvement. Things looked busy and crowded, especially on the home screen. How could I make this better? After doing some research and taking some hard looks at what I had designed, I realized I could improve in four key areas: hierarchy, layout, balance and negative space.
                        </div>
                        <div class="section-text-3 align-left mb-70 mb-xs-40">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hierarchy: I modified items that did not observe proper hierarchy. For example, on the login screen I made the name bigger and the logo smaller. On the course selection screen, I enlarged the center profile image and shrunk the courses and toggles.</li>
                                <li>Layout: My favorite modification was moving the tabs to a top header. Not only is it discreet, but it gives them a classy look of importance and clears the entire main screen at the same time. This was made possible by observing hierarchy: I made the same name/logo enlargement swap, which created the needed space for the tabs.</li>
                                <li>Balance: My biggest discovery was that I wasn't using the bottom of my screen! I had all my options top-heavy at the head, which was costing me both balance and real estate. By adding headers and relocating features to them, I got both back. And using navy blue, I neutralized the busy color palette of the home screen.</li>
                                <li>Negative space: By fixing the above, I bought myself some very welcoming room to resize my features and spread them out more comfortably. This makes things much less cluttered, and I was able to add a home icon and keep my search feature on all screens.</li>
                            </ul>

                         This case study taught me a couple of very important lessons. The first was a hidden lesson I didn't realize in the beginning: documentation is powerful. Of course I can track my progress with it, but I discovered documentation can also be a major help in bringing my strategic thinking up to par with my graphic instinct, which I favor. Because I think visually, I tend to run with ideas in graphic form. However, documentation gives a degree of discipline to my work approach, making my focus stronger and bridging that gap to accountable, strategic design practices. The second lesson is that ideation, though my favorite part of product design, is just ONE part. The rest includes actually designing the product - amazingly enough - which involves process, refinement and decision-making.
